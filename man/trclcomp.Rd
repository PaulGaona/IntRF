\title{Tree-Clustering Comparison}
\description{
  This function compares the within-group variation for groups formed by
  tree partitioning and unconstrained clustering.
  The results are plotted and returned invisibly.
}

\usage{
trclcomp(x, method = "com", km = TRUE, mrt = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{ Rpart object with method "mrt" -- see \code{\link{rpart}}}
  \item{method}{ The clustering method for the unconstrained clustering}.

\item{km}{ If \code{TRUE} a K-Means clustering is compared with the multivariate tree partitioning.
}

\item{mrt}{ If \code{TRUE} an additional K-Means clustering with a starting configuration based on
 the multivariate tree partitioning is generated.
}
}

\details{
  The within-group variation for groups formed by multivariate tree partitioning and
  unconstrained clusterings are compared for all sizes of the hierarchy of tree
  partitions.
}

\value{
  Returns a list (invisibly) of the within-tree and within-cluster variation for all tree sizes.
